      <p><em>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_(mythology)">phoenix</a> bird symbolizes <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIT2owRt0Sw&ab_channel=EpicMusicEmpire">immortality</a>, resurrection and life after

      <p>The phoenix was a powerful being that appeared human.
        It possessed the ability to incinerate things through touch and was immune to conventional methods of killing;
        though the phoenix could technically "die",
        it would resurrect soon after being killed.
        Upon death the phoenix would combust and form a pile of ashes.</p>

  <h3>Origins</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt">[The Egyptians]</a> have also another sacred bird called the phoenix which I myself have never seen, except in pictures.</li>
    <li>Indeed it is a great rarity, even in Egypt, only coming there (according to the accounts of the people of Heliopolis)
      once in five hundred years, when the old phoenix dies.</li>
    <li>Its size and appearance, if it is like the pictures, are as follow: The plumage is partly red, partly golden,
      while the general make and size are almost exactly that of the eagle.</li>
    <li>They tell a story of what this bird does,
      which does not seem to me to be credible: that he comes all the way from Arabia,
      and brings the parent bird, all plastered over with myrrh, to the temple of the Sun,
      and there buries the body</li>
  </ul>
